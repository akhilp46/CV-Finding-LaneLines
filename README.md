# Finding Car Lane Lines 
When we drive, we use our eyes to decide where to go. The lines on the road that show us where the lanes are act as a constant reference for where to steer the vehicle. 

This project uses Python and OpenCVdetect to detect lane lines in images. OpenCV means "Open-Source Computer Vision", which is a package that has many useful tools for analyzing images.
